# RNAPIExample
Example using API calls in React Native (No ReactNavigation implemented).

The format is listed entirely in App.js, I did not initialize separate files and indexes for functions as it is easier to view and modify for anyone's particular need.

This repo just depicts a very standard API call utilizing React hooks and fetch functions, a rudimentary base for swapping out values, and can be supplemented as a template for any initial project or file (hence the neat placement in App.js).
